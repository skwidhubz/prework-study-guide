# <Pre Work Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This guide is intended to briefly outline the Coding Bootcamp prework study for any future or existing students.

It contains bullet points on each module, including the important lessons and handy tips we have learnt.

In this precourse work we have covered basic Git & Github functions, and coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We have used Git to push and pull files to and from Github to our local file base.

By including this all in one html file, the information and tips are easily accessable rather than trawling through the course work. 

## Installation

## Usage

To use this guide, review the notes in each section. If you would like suggestions on what to use first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
The console can also be accessed by right+click and "inspect" on the Chrome webpage browser, as shown in this image:
